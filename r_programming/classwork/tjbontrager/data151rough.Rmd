This table shows that California has a very high number of schools proportional to other states in the country.

As the above plots show, it's clear that the distributions are skewed to the right which means that expensive schools are generally less common. It's interesting to see that both of these seem to have similar shapes, and a hint of evidence for a slight bimodal distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(gatheredtc, aes(x=totalCost,fill=in_out))+geom_histogram(bins=75)+expand_limits(x=80000) + 
  ggtitle("Total cost of attendance for students by residence")+ # for the main title  
  xlab("Cost of attendance")+ # for the x axis label
  ylab("Count") + # for the y axis label
  theme_bw()+theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    ) + scale_fill_discrete(name = "Student Residence", labels = c("In-state", "Out-of-state"))
```
Upon further inspection by increasing the bin number, the shape becomes more distinct. The second mode is mostly just a bump for the out-of-state group, but something interesting appears in the in-state group! Is there a cause for this disruption?

```{r}
tcInStateSummr = tcFactored %>%
  group_by(degFactor) %>%
  summarize(median(in_state_total))

tcOutStateSummr = tcFactored %>%
  group_by(degFactor) %>%
  summarize(median(out_of_state_total))

tcInStateSummr
tcOutStateSummr
  
```

This is a simple calculation of the median for 2-year and 4-year schools for total cost to out-of-state students.

```{r}
tcFours = tcFactored %>%
  filter(degFactor=="4 Year")
tcFours

tcTwos = tcFactored %>%

```

            Q1=quantile(tcTwos$in_state_total, prob=0.25,na.rm=TRUE),
            med=median(tcTwos$in_state_total, na.rm=TRUE), #or quantile(AQI,prob=0.5,na.rm=TRUE)

tc4YOOS_Summary
tc4YIS_Summary

These are the 5-number summaries for each of the categorical variables of interest.


```{r}
ggplot(tcFactored, aes(x = degFactor, y = in_state_total)) +  # ggplot function
  geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
ggplot(tcFactored, aes(x = degFactor, y = out_of_state_total)) +  # ggplot function
  geom_boxplot()
```

These box plots (couldn't figure out how to make an overlayed boxplot with both in/out of state variables) show a clear difference in the general cost between 2-year and 4-year institutions, and that out-of-state students generally pay more.



```{r}
#ggplot(tcFactored, aes(x=tcInStateSummr$degFactor, fill=tcInStateSummr$in_state_total)) +
#  geom_histogram( color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.6, position = 'identity') +
#  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#69b3a2", "#404080"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(gatheredtc, aes(x = degFactor, y = totalCost, fill=in_out)) +  # ggplot function
  geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle("Breakdown of total cost of attendence by degree factor")+ # for the main title  
  xlab("Degree Factor (2/4 year)")+ # for the x axis label
  ylab("Cost of Attendance")+ # for the y axis label
  theme_bw()+theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    ) + scale_fill_discrete(name = "Student Residence", labels = c("In-state", "Out-of-state"))
```
There is clearly a difference here between how much students should expect to pay given their residency status, but it isn't as absurdly significant as we were anticipating given that we hear from high school guidence counselors, specifically about 4-year institutions. Therefore, we should look for another potential explanation for the contribution to higher costs of attendance for some students.

This is a density plot that shows how high the cost of attendance is for schools across the country relative to each other given institution type.

```{r}
# Time to explore the data!

# Commenting out ggplot stuff to do dplyr first
#ggplot(ti,aes(x=year, y=total_price)) + geom_point()

#this is the median cost of attendance for instate/outstate 

median_IN_COA <- tc %>%
  filter(degree_length=='4 Year') %>%
  group_by(state_code)%>%
  summarize(median_instate_COA = median(in_state_total))
  
median_IN_COA

median_OUT_COA <- tc %>%
  filter(degree_length=='4 Year') %>%
  group_by(state_code)%>%
  summarize(median_outstate_COA = median(out_of_state_total))
  
median_OUT_COA

#  mutate(mean_instate_COA=mean(in_state_tuition)) %>%
#  mutate(mean_outofstate_COA=mean(out_of_state_tuition))%>%

```

```{r}
#In the following graph, I want to find out whether colleges with higher STEM enrollment tend to cost more. My hypothesis is that it would be the case.

jointisp = ti %>%
  left_join(sp) %>%
  group_by(stem_percent)%>%
  summarize(medianNet=median(net_cost))
jointisp

ggplot(jointisp, aes(stem_percent,medianNet)) + geom_point()
#My conclusion is that there is no association between higher STEM enrollment and median net cost.
```
In this graph I want to see whether a higher STEM enrollment has a high association with early career pay. In a later graphic, I will want to see whether the trend keeps for mid-career pay.

```{r}
ggplot(sp, aes(stem_percent,early_career_pay)) + geom_point()
```
My conclusion is that there seems to be a weak positive correlation between these two variables.

```{r}
#In this graphic, perhaps the trend keeps?

ggplot(sp, aes(stem_percent,mid_career_pay)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
#attempting to make the graphics easier to differentiate. I'm not sure what the difference is.

ggplot(sp, aes(x=stem_percent,y=early_career_pay)) + geom_point() + expand_limits(x=0,y=0)

```{r}
ggplot(sp, aes(x=stem_percent,y=mid_career_pay)) + geom_point() + expand_limits(x=0,y=0)

  theme_bw()
```
```{r}
cor(sp$stem_percent,sp$early_career_pay)

There seems to be a moderately strong correlation between the prevalence of STEM majors and how much graduates tend to 

```{r}
ECSPmodel = lm(early_career_pay~stem_percent,data=tcFacJoinSp)
summary(ECSPmodel)
```

Slope: 323.30
Y-intercept: 45584.50


```{r}
cor(x=sp$stem_percent,y=sp$early_career_pay)
cor(x=sp$stem_percent,y=sp$mid_career_pay)
```

Moderately strong positive association between prevalence of STEM majors at a school and general alumni early-career earnings.


Boring. STEM jobs tend to pay really well. Let's do something fun. Hear me out...

  ylab("In-state tuition cost ($)")
```

```{r}
cor(x=tcFacJoinSp$stem_percent,y=tcFacJoinSp$in_state_tuition)

Terrible fit. Couldn't predict the broad side of a barn!

```{r}

```{r}
correlationsIS <- tcFacJoinSp %>%
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarise(r = cor(stem_percent, in_state_tuition))
correlationsIS
```
Moderately weak/moderate correlation between variables given institution type.

```{r}
ggplot(tcFacJoinSp, aes(x=stem_percent,y=out_of_state_tuition,color=type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE,lty=2) +
  ggtitle("Cost of tuition for out-state students against prevalence of STEM majors")+
  xlab("Prevalence of STEM majors (%)")+

```
```{r}
correlationsOOS <- tcFacJoinSp %>%
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarise(r = cor(stem_percent, out_of_state_tuition))
correlationsOOS
```
Correlations show that there is a moderate correlation between the two variables given type.

These two graphs support the idea that tuition tends to be more expensive for schools that see greater proportions of STEM enrollment. Possibly due to the expensive equipment that generally comes with academic amenities like labs and associated equipment.
